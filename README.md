# Chile 2018 - Presentation


**This repository was created with the intention of keeping codes, results and other necessary information regarding our work that will be sent to the [Chilean Geological Congress](http://congresogeologicochileno.cl/en/home/).**


**The work consistes in the application of the cross-correlation technique in order to find the true magnetization direction of magnetic sources. As a study area, we selected Serra do Cabral (Minas Gerais, Brazil), where there is an intense magnetic anomaly (*the second largest magnetic anomaly*) that already was studyied by several researchers. Our results were extremely satisfactory and confirmed what has been shown in previous studies.**
